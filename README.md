# Some Old Unity Projects That Survived
Art and code of two project's source code are completely original works. These are some old projects that survived not 1, but 2 formattings!!!(and 1-2 PC upgrades).
I have been using the Unity Engine since 2013 and plan to continue using it and improving my understanding of the Unity API and its features.
I am currently working on some projects and trying to implement better design and practices in my code as well as gain a better understanding
of C# and the .NET framework.

## Some of the Projects:
